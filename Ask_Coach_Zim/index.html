        <!--    At first I was thinking of doing something like a magic 8 ball. As I thought more about
                it I came up with the idea of making an application where the user could ask coach Zimmer
                a question, and the reponce would be something Zimmer has said in a past interview. 
                Being a Vikings fan, I thought other fans might get a kick out of it too.
            
                The plan is to have a user type a question in a text box and have something respond.
                I am going to have several pre determined responces ready to que that Zimmer has said in an interview,
                and when the user submits their question one of those responces will be displayed at random.

                Thinking of fun ways to make the automated responces more specific to what the user is asking,
                I added the radio buttons so when one of the buttons are selected it will register to a
                responce that correlates closer to the question asked. So I will have questions pertaining to a Vikings player,
                an opposing player, about the Vikings team, and an opposing team. I might even keep the typed in responce as a
                variable that I can add back into some of the responces.
            
                The automated responce will appear in a div below where the question was asked.
            
                The whole process goes:
                    User thinks of a question
                    User selects a radio button that corralates with their question
                    User types in question
                    User submits question by clicking the submit button
                    The responce is displayed in the div below
                    User can than click a button that allows the for the page to refresh to ask another question -->
